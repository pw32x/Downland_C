DONE draw doors when picking up key

DONE picking up key somehow destroys pickups?

DONE rooms don't properly initialize drop count

DONE use door to go to next room

DONE draw doors when drawing room at room init

DONE face the correct way when entering a room

DONE death when falling from too high

DONE losing a life

DONE game over

DONE handle two players

DONE add "player get ready" screen

DONE collide with items, keys, and doors even in debug mode

DONE drops positions need to be tweaked on hard mode
    or the reverse in easy mode
   
DONE move drops to the left of the rope one pixel to the left
    
DONE make drops fall faster on title screen and get ready screen

DONE restarting the game from the title screen doesn't properly reset
     the player position

DONE maybe grabbing onto rope doesn't reset the safeToLand flag

DONE use hard mode door indexes after completing the game once

DONE entering last door needs to:
    increment completion count

filter system for graphics?
    
bouncing off walls isn't accurate
jump isn't accurate (too high?)
jump doesn't slow down horizontally

code comment pass
code pretty pass
split rooms file
can make individual update functions for player?
use union instead of GET_HIGH_BYTE ? 



beta testing
player replay system?
