    SG1000: jump sound doesn't always play from off of ropes. SMS/GG too?

    SS: sound driver causes sounds issues 
        - sometimes a sound doesn't not play
        - sometimes a looping sound doesn't stop
    
    SS: if you make a door appear and then change rooms, the door will disappear during
        the transition. But it'll work correctly the next time in the room.
