    DONE PC_new: GameRenderer wipe transitions clear the screen to black first for some reason when
        it shouldn't.

    DONE ALL: PL1 is shown on the top left when player 2 is playing instead of PL2

    DONE SMS + SG1000: lives icons are too low compared to the PL1 text
    
    NAH SG1000: jump sound doesn't always play from off of ropes. SMS/GG too?

    NAH SS: sound driver causes sounds issues 
        - sometimes a sound doesn't not play
        - sometimes a looping sound doesn't stop
    
    NAH SS: if you make a door appear and then change rooms, the door will disappear during
        the transition. But it'll work correctly the next time in the room.

    DONE PC_classic: Downland_C original renderer doesn't draw the right side of the splat sprite properly
        it's because the bitshifted sprite function assumes that it's 16 pixels wide so only does
        the first 2/3s of the sprite. needs a custom bitshifted sprite function, and probably a custom
        drawing routine for it.


    DONE DC: no jump sound or static sound

    DONE DC: walking against the wall makes sound


    DC: Pick up sound too loud?
